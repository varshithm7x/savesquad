## 🔧 Key Configuration Changes

### Constants (utils/constants.ts)
```typescript
// Mock mode disabled
export const MOCK_MODE = false

// Real contract structure
export const CONTRACTS = {
  PACKAGE_ID: '0x0', // Replace with actual package ID
  SQUAD_MODULE: 'squad',
  REWARDS_MODULE: 'rewards',
  NFT_MODULE: 'nft',
}

// Real milestone requirements
export const MILESTONES = {
  BRONZE: 4,
  SILVER: 8,
  GOLD: 12,
  DIAMOND: 24,
}
```

### Contract Utilities (utils/contracts.ts)
- All functions use proper Sui transaction syntax
- Proper error handling for undeployed contracts
- Ready for real contract deployment

## 📋 Next Steps

### 1. Deploy Contracts
1. Deploy Move contracts to Sui testnet
2. Update `PACKAGE_ID` in `constants.ts`
3. Update contract object IDs as needed

### 2. Test with Real Wallet
1. Connect Sui wallet extension
2. Test all contract interactions
3. Verify transaction flows

### 3. Backend Implementation (Optional)
- Follow `REAL_BACKEND_GUIDE.md` for backend setup

- Add leaderboard functionality

### 4. Production Deployment
1. Build and deploy frontend
2. Configure environment variables
3. Set up monitoring and analytics

## 🎯 Current Status

### ✅ What's Working
- Frontend builds successfully
