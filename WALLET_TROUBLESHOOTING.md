# Connect Wallet Button Troubleshooting Guide

## üîç Problem Analysis

The Connect Wallet button in your SaveSquad dApp is not working. After analyzing the code, here are the most likely causes:

## üéØ Most Likely Cause: Missing Sui Wallet Extension

The **primary reason** your Connect Wallet button isn't working is that **no Sui wallet browser extension is installed**.

### Why This Happens:
1. **No Wallet Extension**: The `@mysten/dapp-kit` library can only detect and connect to installed wallet extensions
2. **Extension Not Loaded**: Even if installed, the extension might not have loaded yet
3. **Wrong Network**: The extension might be on a different network than testnet

## üõ†Ô∏è Solutions

### Option 1: Install Sui Wallet Extension (Recommended)
1. **Go to Chrome Web Store** and search for "Sui Wallet"
2. **Install the official Sui Wallet extension**
3. **Create a new wallet** or import an existing one
4. **Switch to Sui Testnet** in the wallet settings
5. **Refresh the dApp** and try connecting again

### Option 2: Use Suiet Wallet
1. **Install Suiet Wallet** from the Chrome Web Store
2. **Create/import wallet** and switch to Sui Testnet
3. **Refresh the dApp** and try connecting

### Option 3: Use Ethos Wallet
1. **Install Ethos Wallet** from the Chrome Web Store
2. **Set up wallet** and switch to Sui Testnet
3. **Refresh the dApp** and try connecting

## üîß Technical Details

### What the Code Does:
- Uses `@mysten/dapp-kit` ConnectButton component
- Properly configured with SuiClientProvider and WalletProvider
- Correctly imports dapp-kit CSS styles
- Uses React Query for state management

### What the Browser Shows:
- If no wallet extension is detected, `useWallets()` returns empty array
- ConnectButton will show but might not respond to clicks
- No wallet connection popup appears

## üß™ Testing Steps

1. **Check Browser Extensions**:
   - Open Chrome ‚Üí More Tools ‚Üí Extensions
   - Look for any Sui wallet extensions
   - Make sure they're enabled

2. **Open Browser Console**:
   - Press F12 ‚Üí Console tab
   - Look for any wallet-related errors
   - Check if wallet providers are detected

3. **Test with Debug Component**:
   - The WalletDebug component shows detected wallets
   - If "Available Wallets: 0", no extensions are installed

## üìù Code Verification

The implementation is **correct** according to Sui dApp-kit documentation:

```tsx
// ‚úÖ Correct provider setup
<SuiClientProvider networks={networkConfig} defaultNetwork="testnet">
  <WalletProvider autoConnect>
    <App />
  </WalletProvider>
</SuiClientProvider>

// ‚úÖ Correct button usage
<ConnectButton />

// ‚úÖ Correct CSS import
@import '@mysten/dapp-kit/dist/index.css';
```

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Install a Sui wallet extension** (this will fix 90% of cases)
2. **Refresh the page** after installation
3. **Check the WalletDebug component** to verify wallet detection
4. **Try connecting** - you should see a wallet popup

## üìû Still Having Issues?

If wallet is installed but still not working:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify wallet is on Sui Testnet
3. Try disabling/re-enabling the extension
4. Try clearing browser cache and cookies
5. Test in an incognito window

The SaveSquad dApp code is working correctly - the issue is almost certainly that no Sui wallet browser extension is installed in your browser.
